    body: `I often feel crestfallen
and the reasons in particular seem not to exist.
And the ironic constant that does exist
is that the more I try to be euphoric,
the more I let myself ascend,
the harder I come down crashing.

Still, the reasons of my misery
are not conventional.
These really exist only in
the slight figments of my imagination.
Channelling my thoughts, manipulating rather;
Suffocating me.

Often I turn to others;
Observing them, for their vices.
Noticing their so called "taboos",
and watching their story unfold.
Their life, actions, anxieties & insecurities
hold some meaning and have a past.

Then I turn to myself,
looking over my shoulders.
All I ever see is a descent past
and the pain I've caused.
Yet, I am audacious enough,
to turn to others and ask for help?!
It feels like all my vices are inherited,
outside of reason, by my own conventions.
Then why am I bothered?
Why does it still hurt?

So am I the culprit?
The antagonist in my own success story?
The alter ego, hell bent on ravaging,
with some psychopathic dilemma like John Doe?
A fiend that uses these feelings to write?
What would I do once I've written everything?
Will I be at peace?
What happens when the same thing troubles me again?

Everything is a mess;
Even the words woven into
this so called elegy,
that holds no meaning or message.
But my hands, 
they move on their own.
Defying logic and sense;
Expressing, me.`,

    body: `Being self aware sucks,
The way you constantly keep yourself from drowning.
You are not entitled to being called depressed
But you're not happy either.
You just are,
Existing on the tension,
Trying to make sense of whatever

It's tiring, physically,
The struggle to remain afloat
And mentally,
Finding reasons to give in the efforts

You're in a state of constant flux
Seeking validation, not for yourself
But to justify being miserable
Finding reasons to hold on

It's not that you're depressed
But you kinda wish you were
It's kinda like breathing
But wishing to be dead

And you keep telling yourself
Not yet, not yet, not yet`,

    body: `I don't know if it makes sense
But somedays I'm so full
That on the days I'm not
I feel hollow

Don't get me wrong
I do appreciate the highs
But these damned highs
They are followed by withdrawal

I am not used to be radiant
That's the reason of me being skeptic
You have that effect on me
That makes me carefree

I want you for me
More so that you can save me
But when you wear off
There's just me and it scares me`,

    body: `It’s 3 A.M. in the morning
I am smoking by the yellow lamp
wearing the same old twinning tee
trying to breathe myself to death

I look around to endless trails of light passing by
and wonder about destiny and our ratracing lives
suddenly among the aesthetics came the wind of ghosts
even scientists love to conspire about things of sorts

They say that spirits are strongest between the hour to pass
but nothing’s really bothering me other than my past
They say demons posses our body, diminishes our souls
and I can’t help but wonder they got it all wrong

The night is calm and our eyes awake, 
head’s stirring and heart agitates
We have our demons wailing in us, 
waiting to scream when we’re worn off

And drifting along it’s just a quarter to four
and I decide to have a walk
Gazed upon my eyes the darker roads
audacious of any demon I walked

At the edge of the yellow shower there were shadows to torch and attention to fill
but the tenuous mind did none of these
Entering the noir, there were no doubts
One foot after the other till I had nocturnal eyes

These ghosts they spoke of didin’t scare me
because we have our prattling all the time
and it’s not weak to have a seat in a corner
because broken are those who are too strong to verbalize `,

    title: 'GETAWAY',
    body: `Today I sat with a thought on my head
wondering about acceptance and pride
wondering about credibility and life span
wondering how we perceive things

it occured to me that greatness is not universal
that legends are not endeared by all
it’s the degree of relatability that you hold
the bond that shows you’re only still human

the struggles you go through and the mistakes you make
the love you lost and ways you escaped
the mischeivious pranks and punishments you had
the sleepless nights and following hungover days

you can only ever be so perfect
that you forget to honour your scars
to be so well over your past which made you who you are
that you exceed out of my definition of perfect

to me perfect is one who knows them well
no Rama required in this era
just give me a Karan like friend

we are a cursed generation
shunned by our own biddings
we all are haunted by our demons
and just need a goto constant

some are blessed with people to trust
some are still on their way
just know that I’m here to lend an ear
because I too had a shout that stayed in me`,
