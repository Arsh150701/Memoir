    body: `I often feel crestfallen
and the reasons in particular seem not to exist.
And the ironic constant that does exist
is that the more I try to be euphoric,
the more I let myself ascend,
the harder I come down crashing.

Still, the reasons of my misery
are not conventional.
These really exist only in
the slight figments of my imagination.
Channelling my thoughts, manipulating rather;
Suffocating me.

Often I turn to others;
Observing them, for their vices.
Noticing their so called "taboos",
and watching their story unfold.
Their life, actions, anxieties & insecurities
hold some meaning and have a past.

Then I turn to myself,
looking over my shoulders.
All I ever see is a descent past
and the pain I've caused.
Yet, I am audacious enough,
to turn to others and ask for help?!
It feels like all my vices are inherited,
outside of reason, by my own conventions.
Then why am I bothered?
Why does it still hurt?

So am I the culprit?
The antagonist in my own success story?
The alter ego, hell bent on ravaging,
with some psychopathic dilemma like John Doe?
A fiend that uses these feelings to write?
What would I do once I've written everything?
Will I be at peace?
What happens when the same thing troubles me again?

Everything is a mess;
Even the words woven into
this so called elegy,
that holds no meaning or message.
But my hands, 
they move on their own.
Defying logic and sense;
Expressing, me.`,

    body: `Being self aware sucks,
The way you constantly keep yourself from drowning.
You are not entitled to being called depressed
But you're not happy either.
You just are,
Existing on the tension,
Trying to make sense of whatever

It's tiring, physically,
The struggle to remain afloat
And mentally,
Finding reasons to give in the efforts

You're in a state of constant flux
Seeking validation, not for yourself
But to justify being miserable
Finding reasons to hold on

It's not that you're depressed
But you kinda wish you were
It's kinda like breathing
But wishing to be dead

And you keep telling yourself
Not yet, not yet, not yet`,
